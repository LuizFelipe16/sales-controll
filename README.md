# Controle de Vendas

### Site created in order to control sales information, especially customer data, preventing address errors. I created this idea out of a need of my own in my work as an attendant, and so I used my knowledge of the time to develop the basic project, but which needs many improvements that I can now do.

Getting Started
=================

These instructions will get you a copy of the full project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

- Yarn is a package manager built by Facebook Team and seems to be faster than npm in general.
