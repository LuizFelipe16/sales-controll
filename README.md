### Website created with the theme of an online coffee shop, with this pretext I was able to add several interesting features such as an integrated Blog and a simulation of products in stock with a shopping cart.

The project can be built with npm or yarn, so choose one of the approach bellow in case you don't have any installed on your system.

- Npm is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
